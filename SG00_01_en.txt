【???】
Hey, hey, what are you mumbling about?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010E2)
There's no sound from the phone against my right ear. Perfect silence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000010F2)
I stand in the strong summer sun.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001102)
Sweat slowly slips down my chin and drops onto the asphalt below.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000114A)
【???】
Okarin? I'm talking to you-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000115A)
A girl stands in front of me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000116A)
She calls my name as she tilts her head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000117A)
Her facial expression holds the innocence of a middle school girl. She doesn't seem to understand that we're wading into enemy territory, nor does she sense even a bit of the tension in the air.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001190)
I cover my phone's mouthpiece and turn to the girl with my index finger to my mouth.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011A0)
A gesture to please be silent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011BA)
【???】
You on the phone with someone?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000011F6)
I nod and put my phone back to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001206)
Still no sound from the other side.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001216)
He's probably being silent because he knows it would be bad if someone overheard him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001226)
【Rintarou】
...No, I was talking to someone here. Nothing's wrong. We're about to infiltrate the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001236)
The other side's silent as always.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001246)
Looks like he only wants to hear my report.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001256)
That's understandable.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001266)
It's too dangerous to waste time talking here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001276)
【Rintarou】
Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us. I plan to have him tell us everything he's thinking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001296)
【Rintarou】
...What!? The <DICT>Organization</DICT> has already begun to move!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000012A6)
I widen my eyes and exclaim in a shocked manner.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013EE)
The girl turns towards me in surprise too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000013FE)
Or more like, she was already staring this way.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000141A)
I immediately sigh, shaking my head side to side as I rub my temples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000142A)
【Rintarou】
I see, so is that {Steins;Gate}[the Door of the Fate Stone]'s choice? El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001440)
I end with the parting password and put away my cellphone with a serious face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001450)
Steins;Gate. The Door of the Fate Stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001460)
In other words, "God's Will" or possibly "Fate".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001470)
You could probably count on one hand the people aware of its existence in the world.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001480)
Well, let's start the infiltration immediately.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001490)
I advance towards Radio Kaikan, which is right next to the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015CC)
This is an infiltration into enemy territory, so I can't risk rushing in from the front like a normal person.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015DC)
Instead of using the elevator or escalator, I head to the 8th floor on the top of the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015EC)
But it takes all I have just getting to the 7th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000015FC)
【Mayuri】
Who were you talking to back there-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000160C)
The girl following me from behind-- Shiina Mayuri-- asks without stopping to breathe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000161C)
I, on the other hand, have to stop for a breather with my hands on my knees.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000162C)
Maybe we shouldn't have used the stairs.... It's too tough....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000163C)
I turn to Mayuri while wiping the sweat of my brow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001684)
【Rintarou】
Don't ask. That would be best for you too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000169E)
【Mayuri】
Oh, I see-. Thanks, Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016AE)
Mayuri smiles happily.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016BE)
She really is perceptive.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000016CE)
She understands the my position and doesn't try to pry any further.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000176C)
She's my childhood friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000177C)
She's two years younger than me-- a 16 year old high school girl, so she's more like a little sister than a childhood friend.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000178C)
We live in the same neighborhood, so we've taken care of each other since long ago.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000179C)
Mayuri may possibly have the potential to become Steins;Gate's key. I used to think that, but I'm reconsidering.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017AC)
I want her to live a life of normality forever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000017BC)
That's my present wish.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019DE)
We enter the assembly hall on the 8th floor greeted by a cheap looking setup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000019EE)
Apparently, it's "Doctor Nakabachi's Successful Time Machine Invention Press Conference".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A36)
【Mayuri】
Anyway, Okarin, Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A46)
She's been calling me that for a while now, but that is neither my real name nor my codename. It's one of those nicknames people give you that you hate.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A56)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, how many times do I have to tell you? Don't call me Okarin.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A66)
【Mayuri】
Eh-? But I've always called you that, haven't I?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A76)
【Rintarou】
That was then; this is now. My present self is "{Hououin}[PhoenixTemple] {Kyouma}[EvilTruth]". The insane mad scientist wanted by secret organizations the world over. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001A90)
【Mayuri】
But that's too hard to remember.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AA8)
In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my <DICT>true name</DICT>.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AC2)
【Mayuri】
And besides, it doesn't have anything in common with Okabe Rintarou, does it-? Isn't that just weird? Ehheheh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AD2)
Mm, she sure seems happy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AE2)
By the way, Okabe Rintarou is my real name, but I don't like it because it sounds stupid.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001AF2)
And I hate the derivative "Okarin" by extension.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B02)
I mean, Okarin. Seriously?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B12)
Sounds like that elf boy's blue potato pipe.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B2C)
【Mayuri】
So, Okarin. Uhmm, can you tell me...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B3C)
Looks like words won't get to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B4C)
She's been calling me that for 5 years now, so now I'm halfway towards giving up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B5C)
【Mayuri】
What's gonna happen here-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B6C)
【Rintarou】
Are you saying you came all the way here with me without even knowing that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B86)
【Mayuri】
Yup.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001B96)
She nods, smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BA6)
We're in Tokyo. Radio Kaikan in Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BB6)
Its 8th floor has become an event space.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BC6)
【Rintarou】
What's happening here is Doctor Nakabachi's press conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BD6)
Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. Famous enough to be on TV. Quite a few patents under his belt. But the entire world sees him as nothing but a laughing stock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001BF0)
【Mayuri】
A press conference? But I don't see any reporters...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C00)
Mayuri's right.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C1C)
I glimpsed deep inside the assembly hall, but couldn't see anyone who looked like a reporter or cameraman. So it's more like a presentation than a press conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C2C)
There are about ten men standing in the hall including me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C3C)
You heard me. Ten.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C4C)
You'd expect more people to gather, considering Nakabachi's popularity and the fact that he claims to have created a time machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C5C)
【Rintarou】
Or maybe... this could be an 'Organization' conspiracy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C6C)
I force my lips into a self-deriding twist as I whisper.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C7C)
I thought Nakabachi was on my side-- well, I've never met him, but I'm sure he was.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C8C)
But he abandoned us.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001C9C)
The Organization couldn't overlook this timing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CAC)
【Rintarou】
I really don't want to get involved with this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CBC)
But still, I'm interested in what he has to say.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CCC)
That's why I came here, wasting an early afternoon of my precious summer holiday.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001CDC)
Mayuri ponders my utterance for a while before turning her head again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D28)
【Mayuri】
You don't want to get evolved? 
<END2>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D42)
Ah, that reminds me, frill-necked lizards look like they evolved from dinosaurs, don't they-. Ehheheh-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D56)
I let out a sigh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D66)
Laughing at her own silly retort... What an airhead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D76)
Well, she was always like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001D86)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, keep your guard up. I think something's going to happen at this pr--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E28)
I didn't even finish my sentence!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001E40)
Wh-what's that sound!? An <DICT>electromagnetic</DICT> pulse!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FCA)
The floor shakes slightly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FDA)
Definitely an attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FEA)
From above.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00001FFA)
But we're on the top floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000200A)
All that's above is the roof.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002052)
【Mayuri】
An earthquake? Shindo 2? Magnitude 2? What was the difference between Shindo and magnitudes, again?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000206E)
Let's leave the confused girl for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000207E)
I've got a bad feeling about this, so I rush out of the hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002194)
I disregard the off limits signs and run upstairs to the rooftop.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002490)
The rooftop door is open for some reason. Actually, the lock's broken.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024A0)
Just as I open the door, I see lots of black smoke rising up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024B0)
Also, some sort of phosphorescent particles are sparkling around.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024C0)
【Rintarou】
An... explosion!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024D0)
I was just pretending to be surprised, but, no, wait, was there seriously an explosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024E0)
This is bad. My chest is throbbing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000024F0)
Pounding and pounding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002500)
Uh... wh-what should I do now?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002510)
Should I run away?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002520)
Wait, why an explosion? Terrorism?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002530)
No, I don't think that's quite it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002540)
Why not? Because right before me-- dead center on the empty roof-- is a strange object.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025C2)
【Rintarou】
What... is that?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025D2)
The mysterious machine just sits there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025E2)
It's huge. Maybe more than three meters tall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000025F2)
Is it a... satellite?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002602)
Is this the source of the smoke, the phosphorescence, and that shaking?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002612)
Who'd put something like this here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002622)
Did Nakabachi prepare this thing? Does it have something to do with today's presentation?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002632)
But, even if that were the case, just how the hell did he bring it up here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002642)
This is an 8th story roof, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002652)
My head gets swamped with questions.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002662)
None of which I can answer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002672)
Just as I start hesitating over whether I should approach the mysterious machine, several people-- most likely Radio Kaikan officials or conference staff-- follow me up the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002682)
And everyone looks as surprised as I am.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002692)
【Woman】
Please don't come any closer-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026A2)
And then, a woman who I assume is a staff member starts to walk up to us while waving her hands.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026B2)
【Woman】
The press conference will proceed as scheduled, so please be patient-!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026C2)
Is she trying to hide something?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026D2)
That was an awfully quick response. It's almost like they're trying to keep me away from the satellite-looking thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026E2)
【Rintarou】
This smells. Smells like conspiracy. What are they hiding? What was that explosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000026F2)
I mumble my thoughts out loud.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002702)
It bothers me....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002712)
It bothers me, but I shouldn't risk getting any closer.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002722)
It's like I'm scared or anything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028A4)
Officials lead us back to the 8th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028B4)
I didn't see Mayuri. She wasn't in the event hall either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000028C4)
After searching for her a little, I found her at the 7th floor landing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029EA)
Several <DICT>capsule toy</DICT> machines are lined up next to a plate saying "The PC's Birthplace in Japan".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000029FA)
She's gazing upon them with a wistful look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A24)
I take out my phone, relieved for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A34)
【Rintarou】
It's me. I have a bad feeling about this. Something might be happening somewhere unknown.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A44)
【Rintarou】
...Yeah. I know. I won't be rash. I don't have a death wish after all. El Psy Congroo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A54)
I say the parting password again and wipe the sweat off my brow with the back of my hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A64)
Ah crap. Quite the cold sweat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A74)
What'll I do if something actually happens?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A84)
Half of me hopes something will happen. The other half fears the same thing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002A9A)
I put away my phone and look back at Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B08)
What is she doing?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B18)
Could she be daydreaming about capsule toys?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B28)
She doesn't seem to be perturbed by the explosion at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B38)
I can't decide if that's amazing or just idiotic.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B48)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, what are you up to?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002B9C)
【Mayuri】
Hmm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BB6)
【Mayuri】
Well... I really want an Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002BC6)
Just as suspected....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002C90)
On the capsule toy machine that Mayuri pointed at, there was a cheap display saying 'RaiNet Kakeru 3D Character Doll Series'.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CA8)
<DICT>RaiNet Kakeru</DICT>, the anime known by every man, woman, and child.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CB8)
Its spinoff card game, RaiNet Access Battlers, is so popular overseas that they even hold worldwide tournaments.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CC8)
By the way, the Upa that Mayuri mentioned is the most popular character in RaiNet Kakeru.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CD8)
Its appearance resembles an elliptical egg shape with limbs sticking out, like a dog or some other sort of animal, I guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CE8)
It's considered to be the so-called mascot character.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002CF8)
Unsurprisingly, it's popular among high school girls. Come to think of it, last year an ugly frog character got popular too. Its name escapes me, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D50)
【Rintarou】
Then just go for it. I can't guarantee you'll get an Upa, though.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D60)
But Mayuri gives me a troubled smile.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D7A)
【Mayuri】
Butcha know, Mayushii's all out of 100 yen coins right now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D8A)
Mayuri calls herself "Mayushii".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002D9A)
Or to be more specific, she adds ☆ to the end of "Mayushii".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DAA)
So basically, "Mayushii☆".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DBA)
But who really cares?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DCA)
【Mayuri】
So, Okarin, Okarin, can you pwease lend me 100 yen-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DDA)
She cups her hands out to me with a look like a begging puppy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DEA)
Looks like she was planning this from the very beginning.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002DFA)
Well, at least she didn't say "gimme".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E0A)
【Rintarou】
Don't act so spoiled, Mayuri. I won't lend you the money. I'll show you how harsh life can be.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002E6A)
I make my declaration as I take a 100 yen coin out of my wallet and set it into the slot. I spin the lever.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002EE0)
【Mayuri】
Ah, ahh-...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F08)
I open the capsule and take out the contents.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F50)
Mayuri tries to peek inside my hands, wondering what's inside.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F6A)
【Mayuri】
Ah, it's an Upa. And metal. A Metal Upa!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F7A)
【Rintarou】
Is it rare?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002F8A)
【Mayuri】
Very!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00002FF8)
We move out of the way while examining the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003008)
A boy around elementary age who saw us from behind tries his luck on the same RaiNet machine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003018)
【Boy】
Ah, a normal Upa....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003028)
He looks at my Metal Upa in resentment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003038)
I look to the side and see Mayuri's sparkling eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003048)
Hey, high school girl. You're stooping to an elementary brat's level....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030AC)
【Rintarou】
Hmph, I'll give this to you, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030BC)
I'm honestly not interested in it at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030CC)
I pass it on to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030DC)
【Mayuri】
Really-? It's okay? Okarin?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030EC)
【Rintarou】
It's Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000030FC)
【Mayuri】
Ehheheh-, thank you-, Okarin♪
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000310C)
【Rintarou】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000311C)
Is she ignoring me on purpose?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000314A)
【Chairman】
--We give our honest gratitude to those assembled here for Doctor Nakabachi's Successful Time Machine Invention Press Conference.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000315A)
We faintly heard that announcement from the floor above.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000316A)
【Rintarou】
Looks like they're starting.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003224)
I head to the 8th floor.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003234)
But Mayuri doesn't follow.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032A2)
【Rintarou】
Let's go, Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032EA)
【Mayuri】
Mm--, hold on, hold on. I gotta write my name.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000032FA)
Looks like she's engrossed with the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000341E)
【Chairman】
Well then, without further delay, I introduce to you the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Everyone, please welcome him with a round of applause!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003494)
Doctor Nakabachi appears, greeted by sparse applause-- okay, more like a couple of people clapping.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034A4)
He walks to the podium up front.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000034B4)
He already has a sour look. Displeasure exudes out of his every pore.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003562)
【Nakabachi】
I am Doctor Nakabachi. Pleased to meet you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000357C)
【Nakabachi】
Now then, all of you ladies and gentlemen gathered here today. Allow me to teach you my theory on time machines, the greatest breakthrough of the century.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036A6)
【Mayuri】
Time machines? Did he make one-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036B6)
Mayuri came back after she finished writing her name on the Metal Upa. Wait, she's asking that this late in the game?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036D2)
With mic in hand, Nakabachi begins a talk brimming with confidence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036E2)
There are about 20 people including us. A little more than before.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000036F2)
But none of the newcomers look like reporters or cameramen either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003702)
Now I know that this is the scope of Doctor Nakabachi's worldwide attention.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003712)
If this laughing stock of an inventor announced he invented a time machine, the world would just laugh at him as if he were out of his mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003722)
I was interested in what he had to say too, but it's not like I expect a lot from him.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003732)
And, after listening to some of his time machine theory, I was filled with disappointment, which turned into anger in a short amount of time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037EC)
【Rintarou】
Doooocc-Tooooooorr!!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000037FC)
I shout with no regard to the press conference in progress.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000380C)
【Rintarou】
You can't make fools of us forever!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003826)
【Nakabachi】
Who are you supposed to be!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003836)
【Rintarou】
It doesn't matter who the hell I am! More importantly, what the hell is that time machine theory of yours!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000384E)
【Rintarou】
You just ripped off <DICT>John Titor</DICT>, didn't you!? You call yourself an inventor!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000385E)
【Nakabachi】
S-someone, throw that man out.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000386E)
【Rintarou】
You're the one we should throw out, Doctor! Have you no shame!? You have no qualifications to be an inventor! Not now. Not forevermore!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000387E)
【Nakabachi】
Shut up, you pest! Conceited brat!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000399A)
And... someone grabs my arm from behind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039AA)
Quite convinced it's an official here to throw me out, I turn around to glare him down.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000039BA)
【Rintarou】
Let- go- of- ...hm?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A24)
【???】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A34)
It's a girl about my age.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A44)
Her intense look seems to challenge me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A54)
Those eyes, whose owner shows no fear, cause me to falter.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A64)
Her face looks familiar. Where did I see...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A74)
【Rintarou】
Ah...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A84)
It's Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003A94)
We haven't met, but I know her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AA4)
A few days ago, my friend Daru-- Hashida Itaru-- showed me a magazine.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AB4)
There was an article inside with the headline "Genius Girl Gives Lecture in Akihabara".
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003AC4)
They say that she skipped grades all the way to graduate at an American university at age 17 this spring. That she got a thesis published in the scientific American magazine, "Science". They say a lot of things about her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B36)
The article introduced the genius girl as Makise Kurisu.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003B46)
And the one photographed in the article is the very same impertinent-looking girl now before me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003C22)
She even had that same look of displeasure in the photo.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D60)
Why would such a genius call out to me?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D70)
【Kurisu】
Can you come with me for a moment?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D80)
She asks me that while quickly looking around with a stern expression on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003D90)
What's with the attitude?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DA0)
I don't think Makise Kurisu of all people would be an assembly hall official.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DB0)
There's no way she could be part of Doctor Nakabachi's staff either.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DC0)
Which means... oh god no...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DD0)
【Rintarou】
Y-you, are you part of the Organization!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DEA)
【Kurisu】
Haah?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003DFA)
【Rintarou】
Khh, if they've already gotten this far, then.... I've miscalculated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E1A)
【Kurisu】
Stop screwing around. Come with me for a moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E2A)
【Rintarou】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E3A)
I'll just shut and listen for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E4A)
Picking a fight with Doctor Nakabachi has clearly attracted too much attention.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E5A)
Well, Nakabachi's staring daggers through me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E6A)
Must be mortifying to be ratted out by a youngster like me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E7A)
Anyway, I can't attract any more attention than this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E8A)
For I am an insane mad scientist, chased by the Organization.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003E9A)
I've got a feeling things will get dangerous if I keep this up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EAA)
I mustn't get Mayuri or anyone else here involved.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00003EC6)
I obediently let Makise Kurisu take me out of the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004070)
【Rintarou】
People will notice if you try something on me. You'll get in all sorts of trouble too, you know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004080)
【Kurisu】
What are you talking about? Don't make stuff up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004090)
She glares at me. Quite fiercely at that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040A0)
Her features may be full of youthful grace, but her expression is devoid of youthful innocence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040B0)
A beautiful agent unmatched in cruelty....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040C0)
I sense some trouble, but my heart is exhilarated for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040D0)
Looks like chaos really does get my blood pumping, heheheh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040EA)
【Kurisu】
There's just... something I want to ask you.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000040FA)
【Rintarou】
I don't have to answer. I know how the Organization plays its games.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004114)
【Kurisu】
So what is this 'Organization', anyway?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000413E)
I ignore the question as I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000414E)
【Rintarou】
It's me. I got detained by an Organization agent. ...yeah, Makise Kurisu. Be careful of that woman. ...No, no problems, I'll find a way out--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004168)
【Kurisu】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000424E)
Kurisu suddenly takes away my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000425E)
What skill! I didn't have time to react to such a magnificent sneak attack.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000426E)
【Rintarou】
Gh, what are you doing!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000428E)
【Kurisu】
Huh? Your phone's off.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000429E)
【Rintarou】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042B8)
【Kurisu】
...Who were you talking with?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042D4)
I quickly avoid her questioning glance.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042E4)
She's... good. Is she trying to make me lose my sense of self?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000042F4)
Recover. This isn't enough to sway me!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004304)
【Rintarou】
I-I don't have to answer you, but I'll tell you anyway. That's no ordinary phone. If anyone touches it other than myself, it shuts itself off. Fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000434C)
I carry such a special phone all for the sake of secrecy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000435C)
I quickly take back my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000436C)
Whew, that was close.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000437C)
【Kurisu】
...I see. A monologue, huh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000438C)
【Rintarou】
...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000439C)
This is bad. Ordinary methods don't work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043AC)
On the contrary, she's the one psyching me out!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043BC)
Gh, looks like it'll be best to do a strategic retreat for now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000043CC)
If I could just find an opening...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000441C)
Then, Kurisu suddenly draws near me with a stiffened look on her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000442C)
She glares right at me with inflamed flaming eyes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000443C)
The light of those eyes overflows with the force of will.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000444C)
I find myself fascinated.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000445C)
Could someone whose eyes are as pure as those eyes really be an Organization agent...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004478)
【Kurisu】
What were you trying to tell me earlier?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004488)
...earlier?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004498)
【Rintarou】
What do you mean by earlier?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044A8)
【Kurisu】
Just fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044B8)
What's she talking about? This is the first time we met, you know?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044C8)
Fifteen minutes ago, I was messing around with Mayuri and the Upa capsule toy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044E2)
【Kurisu】
You tried to tell me something, didn't you? You looked really sad.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000044F2)
Is this a trap? It really does seem like one of the Organization's dirty tricks.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004502)
But would this girl pull something that underhanded?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004512)
【Kurisu】
You looked like you were in so much pain, like you'd break down crying at any moment.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004522)
【Kurisu】
...Why? Have I met you before?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004532)
It doesn't look like Makise Kurisu is joking.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004542)
That makes her seem even more suspicious.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004552)
That's right, don't let her face fool you!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004562)
She's a cruel, unmatched agent.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004572)
If I show her the slightest of openings, I'm done for...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000458C)
【Kurisu】
That reminds me, why do you know my name?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000459C)
【Rintarou】
I can see through everything.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045AC)
I am a mad scientist after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045BC)
【Rintarou】
Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045CC)
【Kurisu】
Haah...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045DC)
【Rintarou】
Smell you later, fuhahaha!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000045FE)
I take a 180 degree U-turn and gallop down the stairs.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000460E)
Makise Kurisu's call to halt go through one ear and out the other. Like I'd listen to the enemy.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000473A)
【Rintarou】
D-damn Organization! If they're sending in agents like that, then they must be getting serious!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000474A)
I rush all the way down to the 4th floor and look behind. Once I'm convinced Makise Kurisu's not tailing me, I sigh while rubbing my temples.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000475A)
【Rintarou】
B-but still, I can't let them capture me yet....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000476A)
Well then, what to do from here?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000477A)
First goal: Find the contents of Doctor Nakabachi's conference. Result: Ripoff. There's no real point in going back.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000478A)
So let's just go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000479A)
That's the proper choice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000047F4)
Then I suddenly realize I forgot something important.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004804)
Let's see now... what was it...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004824)
【Rintarou】
Tchh! I left Mayuri behind...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004834)
That deadweight....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004844)
I shouldn't have brought her along.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004854)
I was trying to prioritize her safety, but got careless.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004864)
Let's try calling for now. Depending on the situation, I might have to call her here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048B0)
With that thought in mind, I take out my phone. I turn it on.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000048DA)
And it rings right when I do.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004922)
【Rintarou】
Hm...? A mail?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049A4)
It's not just your regular mail, it's a movie mail.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049B4)
It's from an unknown address.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000049E4)
I play back the movie with some suspicion.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004BFA)
【Rintarou】
...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C0A)
All that I can see and hear is noise.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C1A)
Is this a prank? Or some sort of Makise Kurisu-style attack? Maybe the noise is supposed to be some sort of make-people-go-crazy wavelength.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C2A)
...No, wait, I don't remember giving her my mail address, so I'm probably just thinking too hard.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C3A)
I click my tongue for being gullible enough to play back the video.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004C4A)
This isn't the time or the place for this anyway.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004DD8)
I stop the movie mail and call Mayuri's phone from my address book.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E08)
【Rintarou】
Tch, Mayuri. Why won't you pick up?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E18)
Looks like I'll have to go back to the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E28)
But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E44)
【Rintarou】
Hah, don't tell me, did that Makise Kurisu bitch kidnap Mayuri...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E54)
【Rintarou】
God- damn- youuu. Is that how the Organization operates...!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E64)
Leaving Mayuri isn't a choice I can take.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E74)
You might call me overprotective, but I can't let her leave my sight, no matter what. She's like a little sister to me. Whenever I leave her alone, there's the danger of her wandering off somewhere.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E84)
Somewhere, as in, not here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004E94)
Mayuri was always like that.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EA4)
...Maybe the source of Mayuri's aptitude for danger was the fact that I became Hououin Kyouma.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EB4)
【Rintarou】
Looks like I have to go back....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00004EFA)
The thought of walking back up to the 8th floor depresses me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005026)
When I get back to the assembly hall, Doctor Nakabachi's conference is just about over.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005036)
Nobody was on stage, and the would-be inventor had already left his seat.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005046)
The 20 or so members of the audience were already starting to pack up.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000505C)
I soon find Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000506C)
She's in the corner, looking around by herself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000507C)
Apparently, she wasn't kidnapped.

I can't find Makise Kurisu anywhere closeby.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000509C)
Perfect.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050AC)
【Rintarou】
Heheheh, did I scare that woman off?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050BC)
【Rintarou】
Excellent. I'll let her go this time.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000050CC)
With that said, I keep my eyes peeled as I run up to Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005120)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, why won't you pick up? We're about to go home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005130)
【Mayuri】
Ah, Okarin. My Metal Upa ran away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005140)
She appeals to me with a downhearted look.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005150)
【Rintarou】
Ran away? Did it move on its own? That's some real fantasy right there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005160)
【Mayuri】
I think I dropped it....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005170)
I see, so she was looking for it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005180)
Not like it really matters.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005190)
【Rintarou】
If you can't find it, then just give it up. You can just go get another one.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051A0)
【Mayuri】
But we can't get one. You know, Metal Upas sell upwards of 10,000 yen online, right?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051B0)
【Rintarou】
Wait... what...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051C0)
That much? For this tiny toy...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051D0)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, just where did you drop it!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051EA)
【Mayuri】
I don't know, that's why I'm looking.... Ah, but even if we find it, you can't sell it, okay-?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000051FA)
【Rintarou】
Fuhaha, I'll make that 10,000 yen into research funding.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000520A)
【Mayuri】
I said you can't sell it-. It even has Mayushii's name on it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005226)
And thus, we glue our eyes to the floor searching for the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005236)
【Mayuri】
Tutturu-♪, Upa-san, come out, come out, wherever you are-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005246)
Mayuri keeps calling out like that, but it's not like it'll respond to her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005256)
By the way, "tutturu-♪" is Mayuri's versatile catchphrase.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005266)
It means... actually, I never bothered to ask.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005276)
We just couldn't find the Metal Upa.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005286)
So maybe she didn't drop it in the assembly hall, but on the 7th floor landing near the capsule toy machines.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005296)
Another possibility is that someone with an eye for rare items picked it up and took it home.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052A6)
Just imagining the smug grin on their face makes me writhe in agony.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052B6)
【Rintarou】
Damn you greedy bastards! Know your place...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000052FE)
【Mayuri】
Same to you, Okarin-
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000530E)
Gh, didn't expect a retort from Mayuri.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005344)
【???】
AHHHHHHHHHHH----!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005354)
【Rintarou】
!?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005364)
Wh-what was that voice?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053AC)
【Mayuri】
Was that... a scream?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053BC)
That's not normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053CC)
Only the chairman and a few other people are left in the assembly hall.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053DC)
Most peple left. Including Mayuri and me, less than half the audience remains.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053EC)
Everyone winced upon hearing that scream.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000053FC)
Everyone looks at each other anxiously.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000540C)
Hearing such an out of place aberrant scream makes all my hairs stand on end too.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000541C)
Again...? Another incident to follow that explosion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000546C)
Mayuri squeezes my hand tight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000547C)
【Rintarou】
Mayuri, stay here.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000548C)
I take gulp and take a deep breath, prepare myself, and head towards that voice.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000055F0)
Not towards the stairs, but to a passage even deeper inside. The lights are off, and it's dim.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005600)
I think I heard the voice coming form over there.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005610)
I lower my waist, keep my eyes peeled, and proceed with caution.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005620)
I turn the corner and "that" immediately comes to sight.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005630)
Deep in the passage.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005640)
Something face down on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005650)
Someone face down on the ground.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005660)
Moving not a twitch.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005670)
Wearing familiar clothes.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005680)
What is this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005690)
Who is this?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000056A0)
I soon realize.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000595A)
【Rintarou】
Hh....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000596A)
Makise Kurisu....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000597A)
Though I can't quite see her face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000598A)
It's got to be her.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000599A)
The impertinent genius girl I just fought with ten minutes ago...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059AA)
...is face down in a puddle of vivid red blood.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059BA)
Dead....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059CA)
【Rintarou】
Eh, wh-why...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059DA)
My body's shaking before I know it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059EA)
What do I do? I want to run. Run away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000059FA)
I come to see this.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A0A)
This isn't normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A1A)
It's unreal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A2A)
Makise Kurisu was killed by someone. There's no other explanation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A3A)
But by whom--?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A4A)
Nobody else is here--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005A60)
【Chairman】
Ugh-uwahhh...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AD8)
I twist my head back in shock.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AE8)
Some other men had followed me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005AF8)
And every one of them was ghastly pale after seeing Kurisu's dead body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B14)
【Chairman】
Call the police!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B24)
The one who cried out in a shivering voice was the chairman of the conference just now.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B34)
That voice was the signal for everyone to start screaming and run away.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B44)
Of course, I followed them. There's no reason to stay here at all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005B54)
Sympathy for Makise Kurisu is superceded by the instinctive feelings of flight and fright.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005BDA)
When I get back to the assembly hall, Mayuri's waiting for me with a tearful face.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C22)
【Mayuri】
Okarin, what happened...?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C72)
【Rintarou】
W-we're leaving!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005C82)
I pull Mayuri by the hand and flee as quickly as possible.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DE6)
I rush down the stairs, trying to drive out the mental images of Kurisu's dead body from my mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005DF6)
But I couldn't.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005E90)
Actually, the more permanent image was the vivid redness of the blood pool underneath the body, rather than the body itself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EA0)
That was the first time I've seen a dead body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EB0)
Fortunately, I've never had to witness the death of a relative.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005EC0)
I never even attended a funeral.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FD8)
This was the first time I saw a dead body.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00005FE8)
Chills run through my spine when I remember the fear-- actually, more the disgust I felt.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000060FE)
I couldnt' think of anything else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000610E)
I couldn't feel anything else.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000611E)
After all, I barely even know Makise Kurisu--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000629E)
【Rintarou】
Haah, haah....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000062AE)
I finally stop once we get out to Chuo Dori.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000062BE)
Breathing's hard since we just ran down the stairs at full force.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006306)
【Mayuri】
Hey, hey, what happened-? You look really pale....
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006316)
Mayuri doesn't seem to comprehend the situation.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006326)
I guess it's because she didn't see the scene of the crime.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006336)
But still, she's not even breathing any harder.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006346)
She looks slow, but she's actually pretty fast on her feet.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006356)
【Rintarou】
Someone... died.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006370)
【Mayuri】
Eh...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000638C)
I take several deep breaths.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000639C)
That blood red still stains my brain.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063AC)
But I've calmed down a bit.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063BC)
Makise Kurisu was killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000063CC)
I don't know who the killer is.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006442)
I can hear a siren in the distance, so I guess an ambulance is coming soon.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006452)
Later, the police will storm in, and this place will go into an uproar.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006462)
But for now, the many Akihabara pedestrians on summer break still don't notice this incident.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006472)
Everyone's walking like normal.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006482)
Walking in search of consumer electronics, moe, and porn.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006492)
The same old, same old Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064BC)
I take my phone out of my pocket for some reason.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064CC)
I don't really have anything in mind.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000064DC)
Ah, I know. Daru told me about Makise Kurisu, so I'll tell him about the incident that happened just now. That's it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065BC)
It's imprudent, I know.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065CC)
I'm in an adrenaline rush. Blood is pumping through my head.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065DC)
I can't make calm decisions after witnessing something like that first hand.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065EC)
That's how humans are, after all.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000065FC)
We're not so noble an existence.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000660C)
I know that. At the end of the day--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000661C)
We're made of nothing but dirty, slime-like flesh.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000662C)
We carry a festering spirit like semen left to rot in the womb.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000663C)
That's how we humans are.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000664C)
Soaked in a little sentiment, I begin to type on my phone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000066EA)
"Seems like Makise Kurisu's been stabbed by a man. Don't know who though. Maybe in danger. Maybe okay."
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000066FA)
I don't know if the culprit is a man. But a man seems more realistic, so I'm just gessing.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000670A)
Incidentally, the stabbing part is also a guess.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000671A)
That's what I think from the amount of blood and the lack of a gunshot, at least.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000672A)
On the other hand, I didn't definitely say she was killed.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000673A)
I can't exactly explain why myself.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000674A)
If I had to say, I guess I felt like writing it would set it in stone.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000675A)
It would make me feel guilty.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000676A)
It's not even like I'm the one who killed her. Just thinking about my strange mindset makes me smile bitterly.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000677A)
I just saw someone's death up close, and only a few minutes later, I'm smiling.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000678A)
Am I really that cruel and cold?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $0000679A)
I'm a fiendish, insane mad scientist, so it suits me.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067AA)
I put my thumb on the send button.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067BA)
I...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067CA)
lightly press down...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067DA)
that thumb...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $000067F8)
And send the mail--

Right after that--

#WRITE(PTR, $00006C58)
No, more importantly...!
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D7A)
【Rintarou】
Gone...
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006D8A)
Summer break.
<END>

Noon.

Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DBA)
Chuo Dori. A minute's walk from the station.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DCA)
All at once--

#WRITE(PTR, $00006DDA)
Thousands of pedestrians--

Just walking there--

Right before my eyes--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E0A)
Instantly--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E1A)
Disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E2A)
Is this a dream? Is this an illusion?
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E3A)
I don't get it.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E4A)
But they disappeared.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E5A)
I know I saw it that very instant.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006E9A)
Wordlessly in shock,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EAA)
I just stand stock still,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EBA)
All alone,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006ECA)
In the vacated Akihabara.
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006EDA)
Confused, I look up,
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006F70)
And in Radio Kaikan's building--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00006FE2)
Right at the 8th floor where we just were--
<END>

#WRITE(PTR, $00007054)
Lies a crashed satellite.
